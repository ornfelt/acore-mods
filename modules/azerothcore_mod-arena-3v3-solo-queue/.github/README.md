# Arena solo 3v3 Queue

- Latest build status with azerothcore:

[![Build Status](https://github.com/pangolp/mod-arena-3v3-solo-queue/workflows/core-build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pangolp/mod-arena-3v3-solo-queue)

The module is currently under development. It works, although not in the expected way, since when you score 2 people, 1 per team, the module automatically calls the arena, as if it were a 1v1 event, although in reality it is a 5v5. (that is another topic that should be discussed later). However, I share the progress so far, in case anyone wants to collaborate in fixing it.

Much of the code was extracted from the [mod-azerothshard](https://github.com/azerothcore/mod-azerothshard) module.
