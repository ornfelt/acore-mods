Module for Azerothcore to teleport players to a mall with a command

# How to use

Install the SQL file to the character database on a GM account make two teleport locations with command:

.tele add

Two locations need to be added for this module to work.

1. VIPMall
2. PlayerMall

Once that is complete go to the VIP table in the character database.

Add the accountid of the player account and also set it to active = 1.

If the accountid is not active the VIP mall would not work for the current account.
