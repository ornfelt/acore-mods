- This is a "fun" script/module converted from an LUA script I found, credits to whoever did this originally

## What this does

- Will sometimes add random enchantments on any item Looted, Quest Rewarded or Profession created

## Configurable

- Login message for the module (on, off and what to display)
- Select if you want to enchant loot, quest reward, profession or all
- Modify the source to mess with the chances of enchantment
