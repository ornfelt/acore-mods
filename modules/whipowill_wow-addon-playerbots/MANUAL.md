# Operator's Manual

The bots are programmed to respond to chat commands.  The game addon is designed to make issuing those chat commands easier for the player, and though the desire is to make the addon a comprehensive solution, you may still have need for manual chat commands as you play.

## Party

command | action
:---|:---
``.playerbots bot add name1,name2,name3`` | login alts
``.playerbots bot remove name1,name2,name3`` | logout alts
``.playerbots bot add *`` |  login all alts
``.playerbots bot remove *`` | logout all alts
``.playerbots bot init=rare name1,name2,name3`` | respawn @ your level w/ max talents & rare gear (random bots only)

## Behavior

The bots are programmed to respond to triggers by listing possible actions and choosing one based on a strategy:

- triggers - what is happening
- actions - what can the bot do
- strategy - what is the best action

Strategies can be combined, so they merge their effects to produce desired choices.  Bots use two categories of strategies: combat and non-combat.  You can add, subtract, or toggle strategies using the combat and non-combat prefixes in your commands:

```
co +strategy1,-strategy2,~strategy3
nc +strategy1,-strategy2,~strategy3
```

You can query the bot to report what strategies are currently being used:

```
co ?
nc ?
```

You can issue orders and query the bot to report back at the same time:

```
co +strategy1,-strategy2,~strategy3,?
nc +strategy1,-strategy2,~strategy3,?
```

### Combat Strategies

### Defaults

- Tank classes default w/ ``tank aoe``
- Non-tank classes default w/ ``attack weak``
- Strategies that are incompatible, such as ``stay`` and ``follow``, are ignored

## Example Macros

To make bots flee with you from the danger:

```
/p reset
/p nc -stay,+follow,+passive
/p co +passive
/p do follow
```

To make bots follow you and assist you in attack:

```
/p nc -stay,+follow,-passive
/p co -passive
/p do follow
```

To make bots stay in place and assist you in attack:

```
/p nc -follow,+stay,+passive
/p co +passive
/p do stay
```

## Help

The bot can tell you all available commands it will accept:

```
/w help
```

## Reactions

The bots will automatically do certain things based on what the party leader is doing.
