# PlayerBots Addon

In the WoW private server community there was a guy named ike3 who wrote a bot script that would create robot players in the game.  You could have hundreds of them, and they would run around and fight and do quests, you could party w/ them, and even better you could bring your alts and play with them too.

Efforts are underway to port this bot code to [AzerothCore](http://www.azerothcore.org) via the [PlayerBots](https://github.com/ZhengPeiRu21/mod-playerbots) module.  This repository is an addon project that will facilitate managing the bots by the player ingame.  It begins as a fork of ike3's original addon package which he developed for the Mangos project.

## Install

Download this [zip](https://github.com/whipowill/wow-addon-playerbot/archive/master.zip) into your ``C:\\Games\WoW\Interface\Addons\PlayerBots`` directory.
